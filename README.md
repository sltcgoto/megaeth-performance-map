# MegaETH Performance Map ⚡

A public dashboard project aiming to visualize MegaETH's testnet performance  
(latency, throughput, block times).

---

## 🔍 Goal
To show:
- How fast MegaETH block confirmation feels in real usage.
- Basic stats tracked by users (from faucet logs or explorer data).
- A community-driven view of “real-time Ethereum”.

---

## 📊 Planned Features
- Daily faucet latency tracking (my faucet claims)
- Block explorer snapshot (tx count, avg block time)
- Simple graph (made with Python/Plotly or Google Sheets)

---
